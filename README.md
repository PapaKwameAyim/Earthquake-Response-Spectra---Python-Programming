The earthquake response spectrum is based on the following algorithms: the central difference method, the Newmark method, and El Centro Ground Motion using ground motion data (RSN31_PARKF_C08050).

The ground motion data was downloaded from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) Ground Motion Database for an academic project in my Structural Dynamics Course in my final year of BSc. Civil Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.
